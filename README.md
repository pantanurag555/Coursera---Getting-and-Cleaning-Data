This repository contains the R code, CodeBook and Output file for the course project of Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data".
The dataset used in the project is available at: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##Working Of The Script##

The code works when placed in a folder along with the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' which contains all the dataset files.
The steps are indented and properly explained in run_analysis.R file and when launched in the R studio and executed will result in the creation of the output file.
The avg_data.txt is the output file and has also been uploaded along with the project.
The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the exact steps executed in the R script and how the data has been cleaned.
